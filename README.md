# ClotheUp
ClotheUp, built with Flutter and Dart, is a mobile app for clothing donations. It offers a dignified shopping experience for the underprivileged, streamlines the donation process, and empowers users to choose clothing items. The app fosters transparency, community support, and positive social impact while addressing distribution inefficiencies.
